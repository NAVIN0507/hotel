HOSTINGER DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
==============================

✅ BEFORE UPLOADING:
1. Ensure all files in the 'out' folder are present
2. Check that .htaccess file exists in the root
3. Verify both directory and .html versions of pages exist

✅ UPLOAD PROCESS:
1. Upload entire 'out' folder contents to public_html directory
2. Ensure .htaccess file is uploaded (it might be hidden)
3. Set proper file permissions if needed (755 for directories, 644 for files)

✅ TESTING:
1. Access https://yourdomain.com/test-routes.html
2. Test each route format to see which works
3. Pay special attention to:
   - /reset-password/?email=test&token=123
   - /success/?payment_id=123&order_id=456
   - /failed/?error_code=ERR001
   - /room/2/ (dynamic routes)

✅ COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:
- If 404 errors occur: Check .htaccess file permissions and syntax
- If parameters don't work: Use the working URL format from tests
- If images don't load: Check /assets/ directory upload
- If CSS/JS broken: Verify /_next/static/ directory upload

✅ TROUBLESHOOTING:
If routes still don't work:
1. Check Hostinger error logs in control panel
2. Try minimal .htaccess (rename current to .htaccess-backup)
3. Test direct .html file access
4. Contact Hostinger support if .htaccess rules are blocked
